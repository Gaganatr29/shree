Understanding Find-S Algorithm and Hypothesis Concept 
The Find-S algorithm is a simple machine-learning algorithm used in concept learning. It 
finds the most specific hypothesis that is consistent with all positive examples in a given 
training dataset. The algorithm assumes: 
The target concept is represented in a binary classification (yes/no, 
true/false, etc.). 
The hypothesis space uses conjunctive attributes (each attribute in a 
hypothesis must match exactly). 
There is at least one positive example in the dataset.
